# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
## Project Objective
This project applies the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify breast cancer diagnoses as malignant or benign based on clinical features. The model is trained and evaluated using a labeled dataset to assist in early detection and decision-making in medical diagnostics.
